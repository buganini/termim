Currently there is only chewing engine.

Use Shift+Space or Alt+2 to toggle Half/Full Mode.
(Ctrl/Shift+Space is impossible to work in a virtual terminal under X11)

	Take fd number specified at argv[1],
	read key from stdin, process, then write to that fd,
	display UI at stdout, with window size Row:2 Col:Inherit
