Try this in sysutils/jfbterm or terminal

Architecture:
	jfbterm/x11-terminal
		termim
			screen/tmux
				UTF-8 program
				bug5
					Non-UTF-8 program

Currently there is only chewing engine.

Use Ctrl+Space or '`' to toggle Eng/Chi Mode.
Use Shift+Space or '~' to toggle Half/Full Mode.
(Ctrl/Shift+Space is impossible to work in a virtual terminal under X11)

About Engine:
	Take fd number specified at argv[1],
	read key from stdin, process, then write to that fd,
	display UI at stdout, with window size Row:2 Col:Inherit

TODO:
	fix rest bug in term.c
	improve termim-chewing
	improve keymap?
