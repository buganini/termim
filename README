Try this in sysutils/jfbterm or terminal

Architecture:
	jfbterm/x11-terminal
		termim
			screen/tmux
				UTF-8 program
				bug5
					Non-UTF-8 program

Currently there is only chewing engine.

Use Ctrl+Space or '`' to toggle Eng/Chi Mode.
Use Shift+Space or '~' to toggle Half/Full Mode.
(Ctrl/Shift+Space is impossible to work in a virtual terminal under X11)

TODO:
